## Inspiration
Arun, shorthand for Arunika, symbolizes sunlight in Indonesian. We believe everyone deserves mental clarity, just as sunlight illuminates the world. Today, many individuals, especially teenagers, face growing mental health challenges that can lead to serious consequences if left untreated. By developing Arun, we aim to empower individuals to manage their mental well-being proactively, providing timely support and resources to promote healthier lives.

## What it does
Arun detects your mental health status through a series of insightful questions. Based on your answers, Arun provides personalized recommendations to help you manage stress and improve well-being. With Arun, you can directly contact mental health experts and specialists, engaging in conversations to gain valuable insights about your mental health. Arun empowers you to understand your mental health status with clarity, using the latest analysis of your responses.

## How we built it
We built Arun as a high-fidelity prototype using Figma, ensuring the app is fully interactive and navigable. While we lack the skills to develop the full application ourselves, our goal is to create a beneficial tool for others. This prototype serves as a detailed blueprint that can be developed into a fully functional app in the future.

## Challenges we ran into
The challenges we faced were divided into two major parts: technical challenges while developing the prototype and concept challenges. Our team had conflicting ideas about several features, but we tackled them together through teamwork and open-mindedness. Collaboration was key to overcoming these problems. Additionally, time management was crucial as we struggled to complete the project on schedule.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As this is our first hackathon together, both individually and as a team, we initially found it difficult to adapt to the situation. Despite our lack of experience in creating both an app and a prototype, we are proud that we kept our energy up until the final step of development. Overcoming the challenges and finishing a product we initially thought was impossible has been a significant achievement for all four of us. 

## What we learned
Through this project, we discovered that creating something meaningful requires significant time and energy. Initially, our lack of experience made it challenging to complete tasks effectively. However, this event taught us that with the right mindset, positive energy, and strong teamwork, even seemingly imposible problems can become manageable. We learned that collaboration and mutual support not only enhance our productivity but also creates a sense of shared purpose that drives us toward success.

## What's next for Arunika
Our next goal is to bring our prototype to life by developing it into a fully functional full-stack application. We are committed to continuously enhancing the app, as we believe it has the potential to provide lasting benefits to many users. Our focus will be on refining both the design and functionality to ensure an exceptional user experience. By prioritizing usability and engagement, we aim to create an app that is not only beneficial but also enjoyable for our community. We are excited to embark on this journey and look forward to the positive impact Arunika will have in the future.
